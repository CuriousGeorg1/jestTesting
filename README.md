#Unit testing with jest#

##What we learned##

With mocking we can isolate the component we're testing from dependencies

A single class or method can be tested without outside resources (e.g. databases).

Doesn't use the actual method but replaces it with a mockmethod

To avoid dependencies with APIs jest.Mock is used.
